Glass Identification Using Machine Learning

This repository contains an end-to-end data science project focused on identifying types of glass based on their chemical properties using machine learning methods. The project follows a typical machine learning pipeline:

    Data Exploration & Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the classical glass identification dataset, including handling missing values, normalization, and outlier remediation.

    Feature Engineering: Select and engineer relevant features (such as refractive index, sodium, magnesium, etc.) to enhance predictive performance.

    Data Visualization: Conduct univariate, multivariate, and correlation analyses to uncover patterns in the data.

    Model Training & Evaluation: Implement and compare several classification algorithms (including K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines) for accurate glass type prediction.

    Interpretability: Analyze feature importance and model results to derive actionable insights.

    Reproducibility: Documented Jupyter notebooks and scripts allow for easy experimentation and extension.

The project aims to demonstrate how data science methods can aid forensic investigations and quality control in materials science by allowing accurate identification of glass types from measured properties
